### ðŸš§ Blockers & Risks

**Blocker #1:** Airport-API-access unclear

- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Delays hands-on-testing
- **Mitigation:** Start software-integration with simulator

**Risk #2:** DÃ¼sseldorf might say no
- **Probability:** Low (good contact)
- **Impact:** Need backup-airport
- **Mitigation:** Architect researching Frankfurt as backup
